In this project, I have analyzed the performance of two teams, Barcelona and Manchester United, and a player, Xavier Hernández, in a football match.
Using a few data analysis techniques, I have created visualizations of the number of passes made by each team, the location of those passes,
and heatmaps to represent the concentration of the passes.
Additionally, I have also analyzed the number of passes made under pressure and without pressure by Xavier Hernández and the number of shots he took during the game.
