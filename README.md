Hello!

I am in the process of learning to code and am fascinated by data analytics and engineering.

This repository serves as a collection of my work and progress in a data analysis and engineering course.

Through this course, I have gained expertise in the following technologies and subjects:

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Seaborn
5. Azure
6. Git
7. PowerBi
8. SQL


**List of projects:**
1. [Taxi in NYC](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/tree/main/1_taxi_in_nyc) -- analising NYC taxi orders with Pandas. Read_csv, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for **Exploratory Data Analysis**.
2. [Hotel Bookings](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/tree/main/2_hotel_bookings) -- analising hotel bookings with Pandas. Read_csv, info, rename, groupby, agg, query, sort_values, idxmax, idxmin, value_counts, pivot methods were used for Exploratory Data Analysis. Customers **Churn rate** was calculated.  
3. [User Logs](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/tree/main/3_user_logs) -- analising customers data. Finding the most popular platform and the most active users. Visualizing data with **Seaborn** distplot, barplot and countplot methods.       
4. [Taxi in Peru](https://github.com/nktnlx/data_analysis_course/tree/main/4_taxi_peru) -- analising  taxi orders in Peru with Pandas. An Exploratory Data Analysis was performed. Drivers' score, passengers' score, **DAU** and **MAU** metrics were calculated and plotted with Seaborn.


It is my hope that this repository will assist you in evaluating my coding, data analytics, and SQL capabilities, or simply provide an enjoyable experience as you browse through it.
